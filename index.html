                <p>
                    An immense amount of food, more than 1.3 billion pounds, is wasted every year around the globe. Not only is this wasteful, but it is also bad for the environment. When the wasted food is put into landfills, it begins to decompose. This process leads to the production of methane, which is very harmful to the environment. With FoodTrack, families could save money as well, as the average amount people lose due to their food expiring is near $1,500 every year. Creating a resource that can save families time, food, and money, all while helping protect the environment is a necessity.

             My partner and I went through various ideas on how we could combine current technologies that are begining to be implemented in smart fridges as well as features that could help stop the possible waste of foods. This could be done through the use of cameras and a scanning and data logging system through the app. We ended up with a list of 30 features, ideas, and interface strategies that could help our idea and app be as successful as possible.

        I went through the process of creating a possible template style of what one of our users profiles might look like. This includes their personal info, things about themselves, and how the app has helped them.

            My partener and I went through the process of creating some mark up for some possible layouts for how our app might be designed and displayed to the user, as well as a potential logo.
