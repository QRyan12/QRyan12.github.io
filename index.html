                <h2>Problem Statement: FoodTrack</h2>
                <p>
                    An immense amount of food, more than 1.3 billion pounds, is wasted every year around the globe. Not only is this wasteful, but it is also bad for the environment. When the wasted food is put into landfills, it begins to decompose. This process leads to the production of methane, which is very harmful to the environment. With FoodTrack, families could save money as well, as the average amount people lose due to their food expiring is near $1,500 every year. Creating a resource that can save families time, food, and money, all while helping protect the environment is a necessity.
